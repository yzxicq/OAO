<h1><a class="anchor" id="advanced_multithreading"></a>
Multithreading</h1>
<p>FLTK can be used to implement a GUI for a multithreaded application but, as with multithreaded programming generally, there are some concepts and caveats that must be kept in mind.</p>
<p>Key amongst these is that, for many of the target platforms on which FLTK is supported, only the <code>main()</code> thread of the process is permitted to handle system events, create or destroy windows and open or close windows. Further, only the <code>main()</code> thread of the process can safely write to the display.</p>
<p>To support this in a portable way, all FLTK <code>draw()</code> methods are executed in the <code>main()</code> thread. A worker thread may update the state of an existing widget, but it may not do any rendering directly, nor create or destroy a window. (<b>NOTE:</b> A special case exists for <a class="el" href="classFl__Gl__Window.html" title="The Fl_Gl_Window widget sets things up so OpenGL works. ">Fl_Gl_Window</a> where it can, with suitable precautions, be possible to safely render to an existing GL context from a worker thread.)</p>
<h3>Creating portable threads</h3>
<p>We do not provide a threading interface as part of the library. A simple example showing how threads can be implemented, for all supported platforms, can be found in <code>test/threads.h</code> and <code>test/threads.cxx</code>.</p>
<p>FLTK has been used with a variety of thread interfaces, so if the simple example shown in <code>test/threads.cxx</code> does not cover your needs, you might want to select a third-party library that provides the features you require.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="advanced_multithreading_lock"></a>
FLTK multithread locking - Fl::lock() and Fl::unlock()</h1>
<p>In a multithreaded program, drawing of widgets (in the <code>main()</code> thread) happens asynchronously to widgets being updated by worker threads, so no drawing can occur safely whilst a widget is being modified (and no widget should be modified whilst drawing is in progress).</p>
<p>FLTK supports multithreaded applications using a locking mechanism internally. This allows a worker thread to lock the rendering context, preventing any drawing from taking place, whilst it changes the value of its widget.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The converse is also true; whilst a worker thread holds the lock, the <code>main()</code> thread may not be able to process any drawing requests, nor service any events. So a worker thread that holds the FLTK lock <b>must</b> contrive to do so for the shortest time possible or it could impair operation of the application.</dd></dl>
<p>The lock operates broadly as follows.</p>
<p>Using the FLTK library, the <code>main()</code> thread holds the lock whenever it is processing events or redrawing the display. It acquires (locks) and releases (unlocks) the FLTK lock automatically and no "user intervention" is required. Indeed, a function that runs in the context of the <code>main()</code> thread ideally should <b>not</b> acquire / release the FLTK lock explicitly. (Though note that the lock calls are recursive, so calling <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gaf6f46de66cc183bc5b38cd364aca4cf2" title="The lock() method blocks the current thread until it can safely access FLTK widgets and data...">Fl::lock()</a> from a thread that already holds the lock, including the <code>main()</code> thread, is benign. The only constraint is that every call to <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gaf6f46de66cc183bc5b38cd364aca4cf2" title="The lock() method blocks the current thread until it can safely access FLTK widgets and data...">Fl::lock()</a> <b>must</b> be balanced by a corresponding call to <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#ga2b9375cc078d9d39161e2cba520829fd" title="The unlock() method releases the lock that was set using the lock() method. ">Fl::unlock()</a> to ensure the lock count is preserved.)</p>
<p>The <code>main()</code> thread <b>must</b> call <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gaf6f46de66cc183bc5b38cd364aca4cf2" title="The lock() method blocks the current thread until it can safely access FLTK widgets and data...">Fl::lock()</a> <b>once</b> before any windows are shown, to enable the internal lock (it is "off" by default since it is not useful in single-threaded applications) but thereafter the <code>main()</code> thread lock is managed by the library internally.</p>
<p>A worker thread, when it wants to alter the value of a widget, can acquire the lock using <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gaf6f46de66cc183bc5b38cd364aca4cf2" title="The lock() method blocks the current thread until it can safely access FLTK widgets and data...">Fl::lock()</a>, update the widget, then release the lock using <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#ga2b9375cc078d9d39161e2cba520829fd" title="The unlock() method releases the lock that was set using the lock() method. ">Fl::unlock()</a>. Acquiring the lock ensures that the worker thread can update the widget, without any risk that the <code>main()</code> thread will attempt to redraw the widget whilst it is being updated.</p>
<p>Note that acquiring the lock is a blocking action; the worker thread will stall for as long as it takes to acquire the lock. If the <code>main()</code> thread is engaged in some complex drawing operation this may block the worker thread for a long time, effectively serializing what ought to be parallel operations. (This frequently comes as a surprise to coders less familiar with multithreaded programming issues; see the discussion of "lockless programming" later for strategies for managing this.)</p>
<p>To incorporate the locking mechanism in the library, FLTK must be compiled with <code>&ndash;enable-threads</code> set during the <code>configure</code> process. IDE-based versions of FLTK are automatically compiled with the locking mechanism incorporated if possible. Since version 1.3, the <code>configure</code> script that builds the FLTK library also sets <code>&ndash;enable-threads</code> by default.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="advanced_multithreading_lockless"></a>
FLTK multithreaded "lockless programming"</h1>
<p>The simple multithreaded examples shown above, using the FLTK lock, work well for many cases where multiple threads are required. However, when that model is extended to more complex programs, it often produces results that the developer did not anticipate.</p>
<p>A typical case might go something like this. A developer creates a program to process a huge data set. The program has a <code>main()</code> thread and 7 worker threads and is targeted to run on an 8-core computer. When it runs, the program divides the data between the 7 worker threads, and as they process their share of the data, each thread updates its portion of the GUI with the results, locking and unlocking as they do so.</p>
<p>But when this program runs, it is much slower than expected and the developer finds that only one of the eight CPU cores seems to be utilised, despite there being 8 threads in the program. What happened?</p>
<p>The threads in the program all run as expected, but they end up being serialized (that is, not able to run in parallel) because they all depend on the single FLTK lock. Acquiring (and releasing) that lock has an associated cost, and is a <b>blocking</b> action if the lock is already held by any other worker thread or by the <code>main()</code> thread.</p>
<p>If the worker threads are acquiring the lock "too often", then the lock will <b>always</b> be held <b>somewhere</b> and every attempt by any other thread (even <code>main()</code>) to lock will cause that other thread (including <code>main()</code>) to block. And blocking <code>main()</code> also blocks event handling, display refresh...</p>
<p>As a result, only one thread will be running at any given time, and the multithreaded program is effectively reduced to being a (complicated and somewhat less efficient) single thread program.</p>
<p>A "solution" is for the worker threads to lock "less often", such that they do not block each other or the <code>main()</code> thread. But judging what constitutes locking "too often" for any given configuration, and hence will block, is a very tricky question. What works well on one machine, with a given graphics card and CPU configuration may behave very differently on another target machine.</p>
<p>There are "interesting" variations on this theme, too: for example it is possible that a "faulty" multithreaded program such as described above will work adequately on a single-core machine (where all threads are inherently serialized anyway and so are less likely to block each other) but then stall or even deadlock in unexpected ways on a multicore machine when the threads do interfere with each other. (I have seen this - it really happens.)</p>
<p>The "better" solution is to avoid using the FLTK lock so far as possible. Instead, the code should be designed so that the worker threads do not update the GUI themselves and therefore never need to acquire the FLTK lock. This would be FLTK multithreaded "lockless programming".</p>
<p>There are a number of ways this can be achieved (or at least approximated) in practice but the most direct approach is for the worker threads to make use of the <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#ga22a404bcaf6641369e0725627d881556" title="See void awake(void* message=0). ">Fl::awake(Fl_Awake_Handler cb, void* userdata)</a> method so that GUI updates can all run in the context of the <code>main()</code> thread, alleviating the need for the worker thread to ever lock. The onus is then on the worker threads to manage the <code>userdata</code> so that it is delivered safely to the <code>main()</code> thread, but there are many ways that can be done.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Using <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gae9e8f440ce2ca05b047c620f75af13cb" title="Sends a message pointer to the main thread, causing any pending Fl::wait() call to terminate so that ...">Fl::awake</a> is not, strictly speaking, entirely "lockless" since the awake handler mechanism incorporates resource locking internally to protect the queue of pending awake messages. These resource locks are held transiently and generally do not trigger the pathological blocking issues described here.</dd></dl>
<p>However, aside from using <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gae9e8f440ce2ca05b047c620f75af13cb" title="Sends a message pointer to the main thread, causing any pending Fl::wait() call to terminate so that ...">Fl::awake</a>, there are many other ways that a "lockless" design can be implemented, including message passing, various forms of IPC, etc.</p>
<p>If you need high performing multithreaded programming, then take some time to study the options and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each; we can't even begin to scratch the surface of this huge topic here!</p>
<p>And of course occasional, sparse, use of the FLTK lock from worker threads will do no harm; it is "excessive" locking (whatever that might be) that triggers the failing behaviour.</p>
<p>It is always a Good Idea to update the GUI at the lowest rate that is acceptable when processing bulk data (or indeed, in all cases!) Updating at a few frames per second is probably adequate for providing feedback during a long calculation. At the upper limit, anything faster than the frame rate of your monitor and the updates will never even be displayed; why waste CPU computing pixels that you will never show?</p>

FLTK multithreaded Constraints</h1>
<p>FLTK supports multiple platforms, some of which allow only the <code>main()</code> thread to handle system events and open or close windows. The safe thing to do is to adhere to the following rules for threads on all operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't <code>show()</code> or <code>hide()</code> anything that contains <a class="el" href="classFl__Window.html" title="This widget produces an actual window. ">Fl_Window</a> based widgets from a worker thread. This includes any windows, dialogs, file choosers, subwindows or widgets using <a class="el" href="classFl__Gl__Window.html" title="The Fl_Gl_Window widget sets things up so OpenGL works. ">Fl_Gl_Window</a>. Note that this constraint also applies to non-window widgets that have tooltips, since the tooltip will contain a <a class="el" href="classFl__Window.html" title="This widget produces an actual window. ">Fl_Window</a> object. The safe and portable approach is <b>never</b> to call <code>show()</code> or <code>hide()</code> on any widget from the context of a worker thread. Instead you can use the Fl_Awake_Handler variant of <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gae9e8f440ce2ca05b047c620f75af13cb" title="Sends a message pointer to the main thread, causing any pending Fl::wait() call to terminate so that ...">Fl::awake()</a> to request the <code>main()</code> thread to create, destroy, show or hide the widget on behalf of the worker thread.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't call <a class="el" href="classFl.html#a7a3b1236b41800d24267288c564b187a" title="As long as any windows are displayed this calls Fl::wait() repeatedly. ">Fl::run()</a>, <a class="el" href="classFl.html#a108a84216f0b3fa1cb0c46ab7449a312" title="Waits until &quot;something happens&quot; and then returns. ">Fl::wait()</a>, <a class="el" href="classFl.html#a08d29d807ea3874b8bb16f7457f64bdc" title="Causes all the windows that need it to be redrawn and graphics forced out through the pipes...">Fl::flush()</a>, <a class="el" href="classFl.html#a1dbb83f1d52001c152ccf8415e3ee6f0" title="Same as Fl::wait(0). ">Fl::check()</a> or any related methods that will handle system messages from a worker thread</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't intermix use of <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#ga22a404bcaf6641369e0725627d881556" title="See void awake(void* message=0). ">Fl::awake(Fl_Awake_Handler cb, void* userdata)</a> and <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gae9e8f440ce2ca05b047c620f75af13cb" title="Sends a message pointer to the main thread, causing any pending Fl::wait() call to terminate so that ...">Fl::awake(void* message)</a> calls in the same program as they may interact unpredictably on some platforms; choose one or other style of Fl::awake(&lt;thing&gt;) mechanism and use that. (Intermixing calls to <a class="el" href="group__fl__multithread.html#gae9e8f440ce2ca05b047c620f75af13cb" title="Sends a message pointer to the main thread, causing any pending Fl::wait() call to terminate so that ...">Fl::awake()</a> should be safe with either however.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't start or cancel timers from a worker thread</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't change window decorations or titles from a worker thread</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <code>make_current()</code> method will probably not work well for regular windows, but should always work for a <a class="el" href="classFl__Gl__Window.html" title="The Fl_Gl_Window widget sets things up so OpenGL works. ">Fl_Gl_Window</a> to allow for high speed rendering on graphics cards with multiple pipelines. Managing thread-safe access to the GL pipelines is left as an exercise for the reader!
